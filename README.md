## .gitignore
Hi, this repository is for my .gitignores file

In every .gitignore I've included extra files or directories that windows or macOS might create

Now it's just a .gitignore for django but I'll add more and more

### django.gitignore
if you want to use my .gitignore for django, you should know that I didn't include local config, db files or media folder but they are there and commented, if you want to include them just delete the '#' from the first of the lines

### Create .gitignore in Windows
Windows won't let you create a .gitignore file easily, because it has no name.

You have 2 option:

1. Run this command in `git-bash`
```
touch .gitignore
```
2. Download the .gitignore file from this repository, it's empty with just comments
